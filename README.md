# Snakes-Game
Welcome to the Snakes game built with JavaScript! This simple yet addictive game allows you to control a snake and try to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

# How to Play
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
The snake will move continuously in the direction you choose.
Your objective is to eat the food (represented by red dots) that appears on the screen.
Each time the snake eats food, its length will increase, and your score will go up.
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Try to achieve the highest score possible and challenge your friends to beat it!
